<h3>Reformation</h3>

<p class="contentparagraph">Loop reformed for 2013 and 2014 activities, as presented by a statement from Robert Hampson. The line-up included the original <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gilded_Eternity" title="A Gilded Eternity">A Gilded Eternity</a></i> era members Robert Hampson, John Wills, Neil Mackay and Scott Dowson. In November 2013, the band played their first comeback show and also co-curated the final holiday camp edition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Tomorrow%27s_Parties_(festival)">All Tomorrow's Parties</a> festival in Camber Sands, England. Wills, wishing to focus on his own musical projects, left the band and was replaced by Wayne Maskell. Loop then played in April 2014 as headliners of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadburn_Festival#2014_edition">Roadburn Festival</a>, followed by more than 20 dates in the USA, headlining the opening night of <a href="http://milwaukeerecord.com/music/milwaukee-records-guide-milwaukee-psych-fest-2014/">Milwaukee Psych Fest 2014</a> at Cactus Club on 24 April. They concluded this comeback tour with the <a href="https://www.songkick.com/festivals/618-primavera-sound/id/17205099-primavera-sound-festival-2014">Primavera Sound</a> festival in Barcelona in May 2014.</p>

<p class="contentparagraph">In November 2014 a new line-up emerged; still led by Hampson (vocal, guitar), the band performed with Hugo Morgan (bass) and Maskell (drums) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heads_(British_band)">The Heads</a> as well as Dan Boyd (guitar). They played at the Garage (London) and in the Netherlands. Their set featured a new song, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/atpfestival/loop-precession">"Precession"</a>.

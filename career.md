Stewart was later replaced by John Wills (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Servants" title="The Servants">The Servants</a>) and Glen Ray, with James Endeacott on guitar. Initially releasing records on Jeff Barrett's Head label, their first release was 1987's "16 Dreams", with debut album <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven%27s_End" title="Heaven's End">Heaven's End</a></i> following later that year.

<p class="contentparagraph">Loop returned with a more polished sound with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdqFzrwDMCY">"Collision"</a> single in 1988. A second album <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fade_Out_(album)">Fade Out</a></i> followed in 1989, reaching No. 51 on the UK album chart.
